This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Password Protection

This site is password protected. All pages require authentication before access.

### Configuration

To set a custom password, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

If no password is set, the default password is `volvo2024`.

**Note:** Once a user enters the correct password, they won't be asked for it again on the same device (authentication is stored in localStorage).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3020](http://localhost:3020) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
